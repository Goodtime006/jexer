Jexer - Java Text User Interface library
========================================

WARNING: THIS IS ALPHA CODE!  PLEASE CONSIDER FILING BUGS AS YOU
ENCOUNTER THEM.

This library is intended to implement a text-based windowing system
loosely reminiscient of Borland's [Turbo
Vision](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Vision) library.  For those
wishing to use the actual C++ Turbo Vision library, see [Sergio
Sigala's updated version](http://tvision.sourceforge.net/) that runs
on many more platforms.

Two backends are available:

* System.in/out to a command-line ECMA-48 / ANSI X3.64 type terminal
  (tested on Linux + xterm).  I/O is handled through terminal escape
  sequences generated by the library itself: ncurses is not required
  or linked to.  xterm mouse tracking using UTF8 and SGR coordinates
  are supported.  For the demo application, this is the default
  backend on non-Windows platforms.

* Java Swing UI.  This backend can be selected by setting
  jexer.Swing=true.  The default window size for Swing is 132x40,
  which is set in jexer.session.SwingSession.  For the demo
  application, this is the default backend on Windows platforms.

The demo application showing the existing UI controls is available via
'java -jar jexer.jar' or 'java -Djexer.Swing=true -jar jexer.jar' .

Additional backends can be created by subclassing
jexer.backend.Backend and passing it into the TApplication
constructor.

Usage
-----

Usage patterns are still being worked on, but in general the goal will
be to build applications as follows:

```Java
import jexer.*;

public class MyApplication extends TApplication {

    public MyApplication() {
        super(BackendType.SWING); // Could also use BackendType.XTERM

        // Create standard menus for File and Window
        addFileMenu();
        addWindowMenu();
    }

    public static void main(String [] args) {
        MyApplication app = new MyApplication();
        (new Thread(app)).start();
    }
}
```

See the file demos/Demo1.java for detailed examples.



Known Issues / Arbitrary Decisions
----------------------------------

Some arbitrary design decisions had to be made when either the
obviously expected behavior did not happen or when a specification was
ambiguous.  This section describes such issues.

  TTerminalWindow
  ---------------

  - TTerminalWindow will hang on input from the remote if the
    TApplication is exited before the TTerminalWindow's process has
    closed on its own.  This is due to a Java limitation/interaction
    between blocking reads (which is necessary to get UTF8 translation
    correct) and file streams.

  - See jexer.tterminal.ECMA48 for more specifics of terminal
    emulation limitations.

  - TTerminalWindow uses cmd.exe on Windows.  Output will not be seen
    until enter is pressed, due to cmd.exe's use of line-oriented
    input (see the ENABLE_LINE_INPUT flag for GetConsoleMode() and
    SetConsoleMode()).

  - TTerminalWindow launches 'script -fqe /dev/null' on non-Windows
    platforms.  This is a workaround for the C library behavior of
    checking for a tty: script launches $SHELL in a pseudo-tty.  This
    works on Linux but might not on other Posix-y platforms.

  ECMA48 Backend
  --------------

  - Java's InputStreamReader requires a valid UTF-8 stream.  The
    default X10 encoding for mouse coordinates outside (160,94) can
    corrupt that stream, at best putting garbage keyboard events in
    the input queue but at worst causing the backend reader thread to
    throw an Exception and exit and make the entire UI unusable.
    Mouse support therefore requires a terminal that can deliver
    either UTF-8 coordinates (1005 mode) or SGR coordinates (1006
    mode).  Most modern terminals can do this.

  Use of 'stty'
  -------------

  - jexer.session.TTYSession calls 'stty size' once every second to
    check the current window size, performing the same function as
    ioctl(TIOCGWINSZ) but without requiring a native library.

  - jexer.io.ECMA48Terminal calls 'stty' to perform the equivalent of
    cfmakeraw().  The terminal is (blindly!) put back in 'stty sane
    cooked' mode when exiting.


System Properties
-----------------

The following properties control features of Jexer:

  jexer.Swing
  -----------

  Used only by jexer.demos.Demo1.  If true, use the Swing interface
  for the demo application.  Default: true on Windows platforms
  (os.name starts with "Windows"), false on non-Windows platforms.

  jexer.Swing.cursorStyle
  -----------------------

  Used by jexer.io.SwingScreen.  Selects the cursor style to draw.
  Valid values are: underline, block, outline.  Default: underline.
