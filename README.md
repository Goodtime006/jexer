Jexer - Java Text User Interface library
========================================

WARNING: THIS IS ALPHA CODE!

This library is intended to implement a text-based windowing system
loosely reminiscient of Borland's [Turbo
Vision](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Vision) library.  For those
wishing to use the actual C++ Turbo Vision library, see [Sergio
Sigala's updated version](http://tvision.sourceforge.net/) that runs
on many more platforms.

Two backends are available:

* System.in/out to a command-line ECMA-48 / ANSI X3.64 type terminal
  (tested on Linux + xterm).  I/O is handled through terminal escape
  sequences generated by the library itself: ncurses is not required
  or linked to.  xterm mouse tracking using UTF8 coordinates is
  supported.  This is the default backend on non-Windows platforms.

* Java AWT UI.  This backend can be selected by setting
  jexer.AWT=true.  This is the default backend on Windows platforms.
  AWT is VERY experimental, please consider filing bugs when you
  encounter them.

A demo application showing the existing UI controls is available via
'java -jar jexer.jar' or 'java -Djexer.AWT=true -jar jexer.jar' .

Jexer makes use of the Terminus TrueType font [made available

Usage
-----

Usage patterns are still being worked on, but in general the goal will
be to build applications somewhat as follows:

```Java
import jexer.*;

public class MyApplication extends TApplication {

    public MyApplication() {
        super();

        // Create standard menus for File and Window
        addFileMenu();
        addWindowMenu();
    }

    public static void main(String [] args) {
        MyApplication app = new MyApplication();
        app.run();
    }
}
```

See the file demos/Demo1.java for detailed examples.



Known Issues / Arbitrary Decisions
----------------------------------

Some arbitrary design decisions had to be made when either the
obviously expected behavior did not happen or when a specification was
ambiguous.  This section describes such issues.

  TTerminalWindow
  ---------------

  - TTerminalWindow will hang on input from the remote if the
    TApplication is exited before closing the TTerminalWindow.  This
    is due to a Java limitation/interaction between blocking reads
    (necessary to get UTF8 translation correct) and file streams.
